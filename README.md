# EasyHIDListen

EasyHIDListen is a utility program that automatically converts hex keycodes (read by [HID Listen](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/hid_listen.html)) into Soarer's converter codes.

## Installation

If you're on Windows, all you need to do is download and run <a id="raw-url" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamhb123/EasyHIDListen/master/builds/EasyHIDListen.exe">EasyHIDListen.exe</a>!

There is no support for Linux (as of 01/06/2021) but I'll see about adding it soon(tm).

## Usage
Run EasyHIDListen.exe with your Soarer's converter plugged in, then hit some keys!
