# EasyHIDListen

EasyHIDListen is a utility program that automatically converts hex keycodes (read by [https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/hid_listen.html](HID Listen) into Soarer's converter codes.

## Installation
If you're on Windows, all you need to do is download and run the standalone executable.

There is no support for Linux (as of 01/05/2021) but I'll see about adding it soon(tm).

## Usage
Run EasyHIDListen.exe with your Soarer's converter plugged in, then hit some keys!
